Known problems with the 3.0.6 PCMCIA release
============================================

o Megahertz EM3288 cards drop interrupts if the modem and ethernet are
  used simultaneously.  No known fix.

o The 3c574_cs driver is unstable.  Sometimes it works, sometimes
  cards do not respond at all.  This also affects the network side of
  3CCFEM556B cards.

o None of the CardBus drivers implement suspend/resume handling.

o The apa1480_cb driver only works for 2.1.90-2.1.124 kernels.

o Automatic determination of PCI interrupt routing for CardBus bridges
  is unreliable, so by default, we don't use PCI interrupts at all.

o Interrupt routing on O2Micro CardBus bridges seems to have problems.

o The token-ring driver doesn't work with late 2.1.* kernels.

o Newer Ositech Jack of Diamonds cards don't work.
