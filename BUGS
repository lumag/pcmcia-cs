Known problems with the 3.0.8 PCMCIA release
============================================

o The token ring driver tweaks a problem in the memory management
  code.  To work around the problem, remove all high memory windows
  from /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.

o Megahertz EM3288 cards drop interrupts if the modem and ethernet are
  used simultaneously.  No known fix.

o The 3c574_cs driver is unstable.  Sometimes it works, sometimes
  cards do not respond at all.  This also affects the network side of
  3CCFEM556B cards.

o None of the CardBus drivers implement suspend/resume handling.

o The apa1480_cb driver only works for 2.1.90-2.1.124, or 2.1.132 and
  later kernels.

o Automatic determination of PCI interrupt routing for CardBus bridges
  is unreliable, so by default, we don't use PCI interrupts at all.

o Interrupt routing on O2Micro CardBus bridges seems to have problems.
  Toshiba ToPIC97 bridges also seem to have problems, particularly
  with Cardbus cards.

o Newer Ositech Jack of Diamonds cards don't work.

o Newer Xircom CE3 cards appear to not work.
