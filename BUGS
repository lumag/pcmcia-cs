Known problems with the 3.0.10 PCMCIA release
=============================================

o Use of CardBus cards with 2.0.* kernels is discouraged.  It may work
  on some systems, but not on others, due to PCI BIOS bugs.  Also, it
  is harder to diagnose problems, because /proc/bus/pccard is not
  available with these kernels.

o The token ring driver tweaks a problem in the memory management
  code.  To work around the problem, remove all high memory windows
  from /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.  The driver is also completely broken
  for late 2.1 and early 2.2 kernels.  A fix is in 2.2.7.

o Megahertz EM3288 cards drop interrupts if the modem and ethernet are
  used simultaneously.  No known fix.
  
  Prognosis: Unlikely to be fixed, since these cards are old and we
  are unlikely to ever get more complete tech info.

o The 3c574_cs driver is unstable.  Sometimes it works, sometimes
  cards do not respond at all.  This also affects the network side of
  3CCFEM556B cards.
  
  Prognosis: 3Com seems to want to help, but has been slow to come
  through.  I expect it to be fixed eventually, but I've been saying
  that for more than a year now.

o None of the CardBus drivers or SCSI drivers implement suspend/resume
  handling.
  
  Prognosis: CardBus Network cards will probably be fixed eventually,
  but it has not been a high priority.  SCSI drivers are less likely
  to be fixed since we're more dependent on kernel code.

o The apa1480_cb driver only works for 2.1.90-2.1.124, or 2.1.132 and
  later kernels.  And actually, in later kernels, it still seems
  broken for some device types.
  
  Prognosis: should be fixed in the near future, but we're dependent
  on updates of the kernel aic7xxx driver.

o Automatic determination of PCI interrupt routing for CardBus bridges
  is unreliable, so by default, we don't use PCI interrupts at all.
  
  Prognosis: this is a difficult issue due to the lack of proper plug
  and play support in the Linux kernel.  Without that, safe resource
  allocation for hot swappable devices will always be a problem.
  
o Interrupt routing on O2Micro CardBus bridges seems to have problems.
  Toshiba ToPIC97 bridges also seem to have problems, particularly
  with Cardbus cards.

  Prognosis: for the ToPIC problem, Toshiba does not seem willing
  and/or able to provide adequate help, so I've mostly given up on
  it.  For both the O2Micro and ToPIC problems, fixes would require
  someone with device driver experience and the relevant hardware to
  work on it: data sheets are available, and I can make suggestions of
  things to try, but I can't debug the problems by email.

o Newer Ositech Jack of Diamonds cards don't work.

o Newer Xircom CE3 cards appear to not work.
