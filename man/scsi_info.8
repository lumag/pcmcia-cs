.SH NAME
scsi_info \- SCSI device description tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBscsi_info\fR \fIdevice\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBScsi_info\fR opens the specified SCSI device file, and retrieves
its actual SCSI address parameters.  It also looks up the device in
\fI/proc/scsi/scsi\fR and retrieves the device's vendor information,
if available.  Its output is a pair of Bourne-style shell commands to
define the \fBSCSI_ID\fR, \fBHOST\fR, and \fBMODEL\fR variables based
on this information.  The \fBSCSI_ID\fR variable has three
comma-separated fields: the SCSI channel number, the device ID, and
the logical unit number.  In most cases, the channel and logical unit
will be 0.
.PP
The reason for the existence of this utility lies in the peculiar
method for assigning minor device numbers to Linux SCSI devices.
Devices are numbered based on the order in which they are detected,
irrespective of their device addresses.  This tool automatically
converts these arbitrary device assignments back to the
user-configured addresses.
