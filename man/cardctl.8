.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cardctl
is used to monitor and control the state of PCMCIA sockets.  If a
socket number is specified, the command will be applied to just one
socket; otherwise, all sockets will be affected.
.PP
.B Cardctl
is also used to select between multiple PCMCIA configuration schemes.
The current scheme name is passed to the device option scripts as part
of the ``device address'', so the scripts can use it to choose between
different setups.
.PP
If
.B cardctl
is executed by root, all commands are available.  If it is executed by
an unpriviledged user, only the informational commands are accessible.
