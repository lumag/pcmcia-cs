.SH NAME
axnet_cs \- Asix AX88190 chipset PCMCIA Ethernet Driver

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B insmod axnet_cs.o
.RB [ pc_debug=\c
.IR n ]
.RB [ irq_list=\c
.IR i,j,... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAxnet_cs\fR is a driver for PCMCIA ethernet cards based on the Asix
AX88190 chipset.  These cards are mostly NE2000 compatible but have
several bugs that are sufficiently tricky to work around that a
separate driver was deemed necessary.  When this driver is bound to a
card, it  allocates the next available ethernet device
.RB ( eth0 .. eth# ).
This
device name will be reported in the kernel log file, and passed on to
.BR cardmgr (8).

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.BI pc_debug= n
Selects the PCMCIA debugging level.  This parameter is only available
if the module is compiled with debugging enabled.  A non-zero value
enables debugging.
.TP
.BI irq_list= i,j,...
Specifies the set of interrupts that may be allocated by this driver.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
.B axnet_cs: this is not an AX88190 card!
Indicates that this card is probably a normal NE2000 compatible card,
which requires the \fBpcnet_cs\fR driver.
.TP
.B eth#: interrupt(s) dropped!
Indicates that the driver did not receive an interrupt notification
for some reason.  The driver will poll the card (with a significant
performance penalty) if the problem persists.  The most likely cause
is an interrupt conflict and/or host bridge configuration problem.
