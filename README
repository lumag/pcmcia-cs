This version of Card Services requires a 1.2.8 or higher kernel.  The
following 1.3.X kernels should work: 1.3.30, 1.3.37, and 1.3.39 to
1.3.99.  Other 1.3.X kernels are untested and may be broken.  All
pre-2.0, 2.0, and 2.1 kernels should work.

The PCMCIA-HOWTO now includes all installation instructions.
